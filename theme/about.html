        <h2>Hi there, I see you found my site!</h2>
        <p>This is the website I made for my Prog 109 class.</p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        
        <h3>My name is Mahmmoud Alnouri.</h3>
        <img src="./images/IMG_-blljt4.jpg" alt="Mahmmoud Alnouri, creator of the website.">
        <p>I am a full time student at Bellevue College. As of right now, I am taking this Prog 109 course as a prerequisite for admission into Bachelors of Applied Science degree program, with a concentration in Application Development.
        <br>I took up programming around my senior year of high school. Most of it I learned by looking up online tutorials and working on personal projects. These projects were a lot of fun to focus on and it gave me an enjoyable way to learn and improve.
        </p>

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Java: This is where most of my programming experience is focused on. It was the first object-oriented programming language I learned and is easily my go-to language.</li>
            <li>Python: I am very familiar with this language, as I have recently been exploring topics and problems that focus on using Python and its libraries. I enjoy exploring the data science and maachine learning, but I don't think I'm anywhere close to making a career out of it...yet.</li>
            <p>I also speak French and Arabic. Unfortunately, I haven't heard of any coding interviews that use those languages, so maybe I should skip those on my Resume.</p>
