        <h2>Photos</h2>
        <p>It's always important to enjoy the moments in the present, but it's never a bad idea to take a photo. Capture the moments, and share them with others or reminisce with your friends about the adventures you had together!</p>
        <p>I used to have a nikon d3500 for taking photos when travelling, but these days I just use my smartphone camera for convenience.</p>

        <p>A nice pair of hiking boots will go a long way if you are looking to go hiking often, especially in some areas that get really steep and rocky. The best suggestion I can give it to get a decent sized water bottle to bring with you. Some trips can be long and exhausting, and this is why it is very important that you always <b>STAY HYDRATED!</b></p>
        <p>If you want to get more convenient, you can grab a hydration backpack to carry your supplies, and keep a good amount of fresh water for easy reyhydrating.</p>
