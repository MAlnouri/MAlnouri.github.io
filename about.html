        <h2>My name is Mahmmoud</h2>
        <p>This is the website I made for my Prog 109 class.<br>I am a student at Bellevue College. I am taking this class as a prerequisite for admission into the BAS Application Development degree program.</p>
        <p>My programming knowledge is mostly from online courses I have taken, and personal projects I have written and developed. I have a lot of experience with Java, but recently I've been diving into Python and libraries used in data science and machine learning. Aside from programming, I do enjoy hiking when the weather is forgiving, and volleyball!</p>
